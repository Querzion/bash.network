# bash.network
This script installs, a small slew of packages, samba, smbclient, nfs-utils, ufw, avahi, nss-mdns, cifs-utils, inetutils, sets up samba, nfs, and share shares, mounts them in $HOME/Network/shared/*, mounts my network shares into $HOME/Network/*, configures ufw, and enables and starts all services. Edit the script to your liking, run it &amp; reboot.
